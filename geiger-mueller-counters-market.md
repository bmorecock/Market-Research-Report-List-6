<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geiger-Mueller Counters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>End Window Type</li><li>Windowless Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geiger-Mueller counters are widely used radiation detection devices, categorized into two main market types: end window and windowless types. End window counters feature a thin end window, allowing for the measurement of alpha and beta particles, making them ideal for detecting low-energy radiation. In contrast, windowless counters are designed for gamma and high-energy beta radiation, as they lack a window and offer greater protection from contamination, ensuring more accurate measurements in harsher environments. Both types cater to diverse applications in health, safety, and research.</p></p>
