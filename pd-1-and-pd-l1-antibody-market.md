<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PD-1 and PD-L1 Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PD-1 inhibitor</li><li>PD-L1 inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody market consists of two primary types: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors. PD-1 inhibitors block the programmed cell death protein 1, enhancing the immune system's ability to fight cancer by preventing tumor cells from evading immune detection. Conversely, PD-L1 inhibitors target the programmed cell death ligand 1, interrupting the interaction that provides tumors a mechanism for immune evasion. Both categories are critical in immunotherapy, offering therapeutic options for various cancers and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
